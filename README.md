# Tech_Demo_Map_Gen


This repo contains what I am calling a tech demo for my Final Year computer science project. This is a demondtration of procedurally generated maps.  


There are 2 reasons I wanted to do this  
1. I was told procedural generation was really difficult
2. I needed to get someting solid done in order to feel like I was actually able to succeed in this project  
  
I found this project kinda difficult, as there werent a lot of resources online about procedural generation in godot 4.5, but overall it was enjoyable
